3. **Supporting Scripts and Data**
   - Various diagnostic scripts and test data files in the same directory
   - Generated from multi-region AWS testing (us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1)

## Problem Context

### Customer Issue Description
- **Severity**: Sev 1 (Critical)
- **Report**: "Large-scale storage system disruption"
- **Scope**: Single customer affected, other tenants healthy per platform telemetry metrics (PTM)
- **Evidence**: Customer provided TCP dumps and performance logs

### Key Customer Data Points
- Request IDs showing slow performance with breakdown:
  - 90% of 10 seconds spent on read wait time (getting data from storage server)
  - 10% for drain time (streaming to client)
- Storage backend is memory-backed (disks ruled out as bottleneck)
- Web servers are not bonded (single NIC or not load balanced)
- Performance varies by location:
  - Office: Fast 1-2s downloads
  - Home: Slow 20-30s downloads

## Technical Analysis Completed

### 1. TCP Packet Capture Analysis

#### Client #1 (Starlink - MacBook)
- **Environment**: MacBook with Starlink connection
- **Key Finding**: High dropped packets at kernel level (68,484 due to full socket buffers)
- **Assessment**: Client-side application or driver issues

#### Client #2 (tcp (1).dump - Oracle Cloud Client)
- **Network**: Client 192.168.0.216 ↔ Server 134.70.12.1 (Oracle Cloud)
- **Transfer Size**: ~9.5 MB over single long-lived HTTPS connection
- **Key Metrics**:
  - 159 SACK events (0.66% loss/reordering rate)
  - Receive window oscillations (~1937 to 2048 bytes)
  - MSS reduced by 40 bytes (1460→1420, indicating overlay/tunnel overhead)
  - RTT: ~56ms
  - Packet ratio server→client: ~5:1 (download-heavy traffic)

#### Client #3 (tcp_large.dump - Docker Container/Server-side)
- **Network**: Similar 9.5 MB transfer to server 134.70.16.1
- **Environment**: Linux Docker container (bridge 172.17.0.2, host NAT 10.100.2.229)
- **Key Metrics**:
  - 447 SACK events (3x worse than client #2)
  - Packet duplication due to multiple capture points
  - Receive window oscillates around 1273-1563 bytes
  - Same MSS pattern (1460→1420)

### 2. MTR Network Path Analysis

#### Home ISP Path Issues
- **Severe packet loss**: Up to 80% and 72% on intermediate hops (likely ICMP rate limiting)
- **Critical bufferbloat**: Hop 10.128.212.97 showing latency spikes from 2.7ms to 471ms
- **Impact**: Explains packet reordering and SACK events in TCP dumps

#### Office Path
- **Status**: Clean and stable with low jitter
- **Performance**: Consistently fast downloads

### 3. Multi-Region AWS Testing Results

Conducted comprehensive network diagnostics from three AWS regions:
- **us-east-1** (N. Virginia)
- **us-west-2** (Oregon)  
- **eu-west-1** (Ireland)

Target Oracle Object Storage endpoints:
- 134.70.12.1 (Primary analysis target)
- 134.70.16.1 (Previously showed 471ms latency spike, now resolved)
- Additional Oracle infrastructure IPs

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Identified Issues

#### 1. Customer ISP Bufferbloat
- **Evidence**: MTR shows severe bufferbloat causing large packet delays and reordering
- **Impact**: Explains 447 SACK events, out-of-order packets, window oscillation, slow throughput
- **Correlation**: Office ISP avoids this (fast downloads), home ISP suffers bufferbloat (slow downloads)

#### 2. Conntrack Table Exhaustion on Web Server Backend
- **Theory**: L4 load balancer hashes different customer IPs to different web servers
- **Problem**: Web server receiving home/Docker requests likely has near-full/full Linux netfilter connection tracking table (default max ~65k)
- **Impact**: Connection tracking state loss, packet drops, retry storms, "90% read wait" times
- **Evidence**: Extensive duplicated packets in tcp_large.dump, abnormal SACKs, read wait inconsistencies

## Verification Steps Recommended

### For Conntrack Issue
Check suspect web server(s):
```bash
cat /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_count
cat /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_max
dmesg | grep -i conntrack
ethtool -S eth0 | grep -Ei 'drop|error|overrun|fifo'
cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack | wc -l
```

### For Bufferbloat Issue
Run customer ISP path tests:
```bash
ping -c 100 -i 0.2 134.70.16.1 | tee ping.log
# Look for high RTT variance / big max RTT values
```

### Additional Diagnostics
- Correlate slow request IDs with backend web servers
- Capture TCP from web server → storage path
- Test rerouting customer requests to different backend servers
- External bufferbloat tests (DSLReports)

## Current Network Analysis Findings

### Performance Improvements Noted
- **134.70.16.1**: Previously showed 471ms latency spikes, now resolved in recent testing
- **Regional optimization**: Identified optimal AWS regions for Oracle Object Storage access

### Recommendations Implemented in Reports
